        Originally founded in 1993 in France as <b>Traducteurs sans Frontières</b> by Lori Thicke and Ros Smith-Thomas to link
        the world’s translators to vetted NGOs that focus on health, nutrition and education, <b>Translators without
        Borders (TWB)</b> is a U. S. non-profit organization that aims to close the language gaps that hinder critical
        humanitarian efforts worldwide. We recognize that the effectiveness of any aid program depends on delivering
        information in the language of the affected population. By maintaining a global network of professional
        translators, we help non-profits organizations overcome communication barriers, increasing access to critical
        information and services while fostering a climate of understanding, respect and dignity in times of great need.
